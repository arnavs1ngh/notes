# Arnav's Notes

Link here: [arnavs1ngh.github.io/notes](arnavs1ngh.github.io/notes)

Intended to be a place to host all the original lecture notes and concise summaries of the undergraduate mathematics course at Imperial College London - in particular the modules I have chosen to take.

People are welcome to contribute to this repository by adding their own notes or by improving the existing ones - please contact me if you would like to do so, details on that are available on the website itself.
