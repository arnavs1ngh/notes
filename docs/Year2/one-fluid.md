# Multivariable Calculus & Differential Equations

This approximation allows you to describe a mixture of fluids using the standard forms of equations of state. To do this you use "mixing rules" to describe the constants, *a, b* for the van der Waals equations, as functions of the constants of the constituent fluids.

From statistical mechanics you can describe exact results for the virial equation for mixtures. The virial coefficients are related to the intermolecular potential between molecules, and for pure fluids they are functions of temperature only.

$$ \begin{aligned}
Z &= \frac{Pv}{RT} = 1 + \frac{B}{v} + \frac{C}{v^2} + ... \\
B &= \sum_i \sum_j x_ix_jB_{ij}(T)\\
C &= \sum_i \sum_j \sum_k x_ix_jx_kC_{ijk}(T), etc.
\end{aligned} $$
