This website is intended as a one-stop shop for all your mathematical needs. Notes here will be available for all years as I go through and upload them.

This hopes to be a better blackboard. Denser, more concise and more navigable.

Notes provided by: Arnav Singh (Y2) and Louis Gibson (Y1)

This is a website based off of the ["Just the Docs"](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) Jekyll theme by Patrick Marsceill.
