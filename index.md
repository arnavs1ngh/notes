This website is intended as a one-stop shop for all your mathematical needs. Notes here will be available for all years as I go through and upload them.

This hopes to be a better blackboard. Denser, more concise and more navigable.

Notes provided by: Arnav Singh (Y3) and Louis Gibson (Y2)

<!-- This is a website based off of the ["Just the Docs"](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) Jekyll theme by Patrick Marsceill. -->

If you would like to access the github repo to download all the pdfs in one location you can do so via this link: [Github Repository](https://github.com/arnavs1ngh/notes), a simple download of the **pdfs** folder will suffice.
